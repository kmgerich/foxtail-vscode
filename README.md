# Foxtail Theme for VS Code

# Goal

This theme attempts to make VS Code look at home on a MacOS Desktop. It was inspired by XCode, Coda, and MacOS itself.

# Rough To Do List

1. Icon theme (folders, files, etc.)
2. Graphite variation
3. Dark mode variation

# Contributing

Yep.

# Installation

Some day I'll submit this to the proper authorities.

# Recommended companion extensions


# Settings that I use which may enhance the look of the theme

Add to settings.json.
